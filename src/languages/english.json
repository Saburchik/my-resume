    "description-first": "The last few years I've been trying to get in a European college with a degree in IT Systems Development. For one reason or another - I couldn't do it. When came the wave of IT and technologies that simplify and automate web-development, and web-development is what I'm interested in. I decided to gradually master the material about frontend from open sources/documentation. During this time I've learned - to learn. I learned how to solve tasks and understand some fundamental things on the web. In addition, I also began to be interested in personal productivity, I want to develop faster and do more.",
